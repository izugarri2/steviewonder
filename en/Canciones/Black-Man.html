<div style="text-align: justify; background-color:#07010F; border-radius:12px; opacity:0.8; border:groove #3A4657">"<font color="#99CCFF">Black Man</font>" was written about Wonder's desire for worldwide interracial harmony, and criticism of racism, as evidenced in earlier works such as "Living for the City". The lyrics referred prominently to Crispus Attucks, widely considered the first martyr of the American Revolution. Wonder deliberately chose this theme as the United States Bicentennial was underway at the time of recording.
<br><br>
The song uses color-based terminology; (i.e. black, red, yellow, white, brown) to describe different racial groups and although this language has become less acceptable culturally, these terms are mentioned below, as in the original form of the song, along with the activity for which the song holds each historical figure to be famous.
<br><br> The opening verses refer to 12 people, or groups of people.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66F5EA">1)a black man, first man to die for the American flag (Crispus Attucks). <br>
2)a redman, first people on American ground (Native American people).<br>
3)a brown man, guide on the first Columbus trip (Pedro Alonso Niño).<br>
4)the yellow man, laid tracks for railroads (Chinese workers). <br>
5)a black man, first heart surgeon (Dr. Daniel Hale Williams).<br>
6)a redman, helped pilgrims to survive at Plymouth (Squanto).<br>
7)a brown man, leader for farm workers' rights (Cesar Chavez).<br>

First man to die<br>
  For the flag we now hold high (Crispus Attucks)<br>
  Was a black man<br>
  <br>
  The ground were we stand<br>
  With the flag held in our hand<br>
  Was first the redman's<br>
  <br>
  Guide of a ship<br>
  On the first Columbus trip (Pedro Alonzo Nino)<br>
  Was a brown man<br>
  <br>
  The railroads for trains<br>
  Came on tracking that was laid<br>
  By the yellow man<br>
  <br>
  We pledge allegiance<br>
  All our lives<br>
  To the magic colors<br>
  Red, blue and white<br>
  But we all must be given<br>
  The liberty that we defend<br>
  For with justice not for all men<br>
  History will repeat again<br>
  It's time we learned<br>
  This World Was Made For All Men<br>
  <br>
  Heart surgery<br>
  Was first done successfully<br>
  By a black man (Dr Daniel Hale Williams)<br>
  <br>
  Friendly man who died<br>
  But helped the pilgrims to survive (Squanto)<br>
  Was a redman<br>
  <br>
  Farm workers rights<br>
  Were lifted to new heights (Caesar Chavez)<br>
  By a brown man<br>

  It's time we learned<br>
  This World Was Made For All Men<br>
  <br>
  Here me out...<br>
  <br>
  Now I know the birthday of a nation<br>
  Is a time when a country celebrates<br>
  But as your hand touches your heart<br>
  Remember we all played a part in America<br>
  To help that banner wave<br>
  <br>
  First clock to be made<br>
  In America was created<br>
  By a black man (Benjamin Banneker)<br>
  <br>
  Scout who used no chart<br>
  Helped lead Lewis and Clark<br>
  Was a redman (Sacagawea)<br>
  <br>
  Use of martial arts<br>
  In our country got its start<br>
  By a yellow man<br>
  <br>
  And the leader with a pen<br>
  Signed his name to free all men<br>
  Was a white man (Abraham Lincoln)<br>
  <br>
  We pledge allegiance<br>
  All our lives<br>
  To the magic colors<br>
  Red, blue and white<br>
  But we all must be given<br>

<div style="text-align: justify; background-color:#07010F; border-radius:12px; border:groove #3A4657">In one of the most creative periods of the soul, Stevie Wonder released <font color="#00FFFF">Songs in the key of life</font>. Despite the tight control exercised Barry Gordy over the Motown artists, was one of the few who, along with Marvin Gaye, managed to escape capture in their records and what his mind could create. In this double album, Stevie had collaborations with many artists, including musicians and vocalists such as large, Michael Sembello, Herbie Hancock, Nathan Watts, Minnie Riperton, Deniece Williams, George Benson ... and we discovered <font color="#00FFFF">compositions of heavenly delicacy, instrumentation with a higher evolutionary level and inspiration only possible for a divine
  touch</font>.
<br><br>The album <font color="#00FFFF">debuted at No.1 in the USA charts</font> and stayed there for 14 consecutive weeks. He <font color="#00FFFF">was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, winning four of them</font>, highlighting the best production, disco and R&B singer. The album is part of the <font color="#00FFFF">U.S. Library of Congress</font> which preserves the audio events that are culturally, historically or aesthetically important, <font color="#00FFFF">Diamond disc</font>, and above all is an album where both black and white, lovers of pop, soul, jazz, rock or any genre will find <font color="#00FFFF">the oasis in the desert thirsty, paradise in hell hotter and oxygen to survive in the deepest ocean</font>.
<br><br>His importance to the significance and influence that has made music that has achieved classic status. Stevie is aware of what led to this work in his life and in the world of music, and pay tribute in a tour live 2014 performing adaptations for more than 10 cities across North America, beginning Nov. 6 in New York (Madison Square Garden), and having invited as India.Arie, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and other artists that we'll be adding  to this <font color="#00FFFF">SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE PERFORMANCE.</font>
<br><br>It is undoubtedly <font color="#00FFFF">one of the best albums ever made</font>, <font color="#00FFFF">a nectar available to our ears</font> as such must necessarily be savored.</div>
